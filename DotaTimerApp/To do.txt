PRIORITY
-Completely rewrite Timer App Logic, all new hooks using the GameTimersClassLibrary, so may be worth doing from scratch.
-Find a way to interface between form and logic so that differnt UIs could easily be hooked in

CLEANUP ONCE PRIORITY DONE
-Remove TimeSpanCalc Class in DotaTimerApp as it shouldn't be required anymore

Further refactoring
-Possibly Move ThreadInvokeHelper to own project class library
-Possibly move out stopwatch logic
-Move TTS out

More tests
Add tests for form logic
Add tests for string library


Wishlist
-Implement Settings and reading them to feed into notifications and using settings
-Potentially redo UI in WPF
